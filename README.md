# Huffam Compression

<br />

Compression refers to the process of reducing the size of data to save space or decrease data transmission time. During compression, data is transformed into a more efficient representation that occupies less space or has fewer bits.

There are many compression techniques, including lossless and lossy compression. Lossless compression allows for the recovery of the original data without any loss of information, while lossy compression introduces some information loss but may result in higher compression.


Huffman compression is a lossless data compression technique that involves assigning shorter bit codes to more frequently occurring symbols and longer bit codes to less frequently occurring symbols. This technique was developed by David Huffman in 1952.

The process of Huffman compression begins with analyzing the input data to determine the frequency of each symbol.
